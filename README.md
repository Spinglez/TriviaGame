# TriviaGame

Attempting to make a trivia game using jQuery and Javascript timers, combination of both!? (gasp) 

initial idea is to have the entire page expect the background generated via Javascript, start button is a must. Leaning on bootstrap for the HTML/CSS but might throw that out the window.

Game will function by hitting start and then going through each question, questions are individually timed, they will tell you if you're wrong or write before resuming the timer on the next part. Haven't settled on the theme but by the time I remember to update this readme you'll be playing!

Cheers!
